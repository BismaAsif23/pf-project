## Student Information
**Name:** [Bisma Asif]  
**Roll No:** [069]  
**Section:** [BSDS-1A]  
**Subject:** [Proramming Fundamental]
**Project:** [Data Analysis]

## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing data using *Python functions* to preprocess and extract insights. The dataset utilized is tailored to explore patterns, trends, and statistical information through custom functions and libraries like *pandas* and *matplotlib*.

### Dataset Details:
- *Rows:* 203
- *Columns:* 6
- *Attributes:* Includes various columns depending on the dataset used, such as numerical, categorical, and calculated fields. The attributes will be manipulated using functions to derive meaningful results.

### Project Objectives:
1. *Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:*
   - Handle missing values effectively.
   - Rename or reformat columns for better usability.
   - Filter and sort data as needed.

This dataset was obtained from Kaggle, a platform for data science and machine learning projects.
2. *Statistical Summaries:*
   - Use functions to calculate mean, median, mode, and other descriptive statistics.
   - Summarize data trends, such as totals and averages.

3. *Visualization:*
   - Develop plots (bar charts, line,pie graph etc.) using functions.
   - Display trends visually for easier interpretation.

4. *Function Design:*
   - Create reusable Python functions for:
     - Data filtering and grouping.
     - Statistical calculations.
     - Visualization generation.

## Key Insights
- Functions simplify repetitive tasks, enhancing code efficiency and readability.
- Statistical and visual analyses reveal trends and patterns in the dataset.
- The project highlights the importance of modular programming in data analysis.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- *Python*
- *pandas* for data manipulation
- *matplotlib* and *seaborn* for visualization

## Future Enhancements
- *Interactive Dashboards:* Incorporate libraries like *Plotly* or *Dash* for dynamic visualizations.
- *Machine Learning Integration:* Use the preprocessed data for predictive analytics.
- *Advanced Statistical Functions:* Introduce hypothesis testing and correlationÂ analysis.
